        <!-- Project 1 -->
        <div class="project">
            <h2>Robo Drive</h2>
            <p>A hand-following car bot that uses an IR sensor to detect obstacles or hand gestures. When a hand is placed in front, the bot moves forward, mimicking motion sensing. It’s a simple yet smart example of sensor-based automation.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project 2 -->
        <div class="project">
            <h2>VoxaLens</h2>
            <p>An AI-powered smart lens that converts spoken words into text in real-time using speech-to-text technology. Designed to help people with hearing disabilities or in noisy environments, it makes communication more accessible and futuristic.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Add more projects here -->
        
        <div class="project">
            <h2>Inkscape Reality</h2>
            <p>A physical sketching machine that turns real images into pencil sketches using Inkscape extensions. The system processes the image digitally and then draws it out on paper, blending software precision with hardware creativity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>LazerGaze Bot</h2>
            <p>An intelligent bot that tracks human face movements in real-time and responds by rotating in the same direction. It also uses a laser pointer that aligns with hand gestures to highlight objects or locations, making it useful for presentations, assistive tech, and futuristic interactions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>H-Trak</h2>
            <p>H-Trak is a human motion tracking project that uses computer vision to capture and simulate real-time body movements. A 3D human figure is created in Blender, which mirrors hand gestures, face expressions, and full-body poses with high accuracy</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>AI Photo Booth</h2>
            <p>A smart photo booth that captures real-time images and transforms them into different artistic styles using AI. Users can choose from various effects like cartoon, sketch, or futuristic looks, and the system instantly generates the styled version. It’s a fun and creative fusion of photography and AI image generation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Sky Rover</h2>
            <p>A custom-built drone designed for smooth and stable flight, perfect for capturing cinematic aerial videos. It uses high-resolution camera support and intelligent flight controls to shoot dynamic shots from the sky, making it ideal for filmmaking, exploration, and landscape photography.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Memory Matrix</h2>
            <p>A fun and challenging Python-based game built on Trinket that tests your memory skills. Players have to memorise and repeat randomly generated patterns within a grid. As the levels go up, the difficulty increases, making it a perfect brain-training and focus-boosting game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>AI Rock-Paper-Scissor</h2>
            <p>An interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game where an AI bot plays against a human using computer vision. A camera captures the player’s hand gesture, and the AI responds with its move using a physical model powered by Arduino and motors. It’s a cool mix of gameplay, robotics, and machine learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Guide नेत्र</h2>
            <p>A voice-assisted app built using MIT App Inventor, specially designed for visually impaired users. It detects nearby obstacles and alerts the user through audio feedback. The app also features an SOS button for making instant emergency calls, offering both safety and independence to those with visual disabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Bio Blueprint</h2>
            <p>A 3D animated model created in Blender that showcases a futuristic, sustainable city design. It highlights eco-friendly structures, renewable energy setups, and green spaces through smooth animations. The project blends creativity and environmental awareness to promote sustainable living through visual storytelling.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
